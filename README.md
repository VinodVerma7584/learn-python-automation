# Learn Python Automation : is a guids for DevOps Automation step-by-step roadmap to learn Python scripting for automation in DevOps, along with explanations and learning resources for each stages

## 🧩 Phase A: Python Basics

### 🎯 Goal: Understand Python syntax and core concepts
- Topics to Learn:

1. Variables, Data Types
2. Control Flow (if, for, while)
3. Functions
4. Lists
5. Tuples
6. Dictionaries
7. Sets
8. File handling (read/write)
9. Exception Handling

### Resources:
- W3Schools Python Tutorial
- Python Docs - Official
- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (great for automation)

## 🛠️ Phase B: Python for Scripting & Automation

### 🎯 Goal: Start writing scripts to automate basic tasks

- What to Practice:
1. Writing scripts to parse files (logs, configs)
2. Rename/move/delete files and directories
3. Automate user creation or group modifications (Linux)
4. Schedule jobs using cron + Python
5. Tools/Libraries:
6. os and shutil for filesystem tasks
7. subprocess for shell commands
8. argparse for CLI arguments

### Mini Projects:
1. Log file cleaner
2. Disk usage notifier
3. File backup automation

## ☁️ Phase C: Python with DevOps Tools

### 🎯 Goal: Automate real DevOps workflows
- Key Areas:

1. CI/CD Integration
- Use Python to trigger GitHub Actions or Jenkins jobs
- Use APIs to automate workflows (e.g., GitHub API with requests)

2. Cloud Automation (AWS)
 Use Boto3 to:
- Launch EC2 instances
- Manage S3 buckets
- Monitor CloudWatch logs

3. Kubernetes Automation
- Use kubectl with Python’s subprocess
- Use kubernetes Python client to:
- Deploy resources
- Monitor pods/services
- Update config maps

4. Infrastructure as Code Scripting
- Automate Terraform CLI with Python
- Write Python scripts to manage Ansible playbooks

## ⚙️ Phase D: Build Real DevOps Automation Projects

### 🎯 Goal: Apply everything with real-world use cases
Projects:

- Python script to monitor server health and alert via Slack
- Automated deployment script using GitHub + ArgoCD + Kubernetes
- Auto-scale EC2 instances based on CloudWatch metrics
- Python bot to approve PRs based on checks (via GitHub API)

## 🧠 How to Practice Effectively
Activity	Description
- ✅ Build & break things	Test scripts in a safe sandbox or VM
- 📘 Document everything	Write README + inline comments
- 🌐 Share on GitHub	Use version control to track progress
